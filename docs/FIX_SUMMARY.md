# Fix Summary: Catalog Execution & Form Validation

## Branch: `fix/catalog_execution`

This branch contains two major fixes related to catalog execution and form validation.

## Commits

### 1. Fix: Move validate_inputs inside try-catch (0df4e8b)

**Problem:** Jobs were hanging at "RUNNING" state when validation errors occurred.

**Root Cause:** The `validate_inputs()` call in `catalog_execute.py` was outside the try-catch block, so validation errors weren't being caught and the job status was never updated to FAILED.

**Solution:**
- Moved `validate_inputs()` inside the try-catch block
- Now all validation errors are properly caught
- Job status correctly transitions to FAILED with error details
- Manually fixed the hanging job `b4aeb3bc2b2e4bd4a5c2e750aededde5` in Redis

**Files Changed:**
- `/worker/catalog_execute.py`
- `/docs/CATALOG_EXECUTION_HANGING_FIX.md` (new)

---

### 2. Feat: Add comprehensive client-side form validation (261eaa2)

**Problem:** Users could submit forms without filling required fields, causing validation errors at the worker level.

**Root Cause:** No client-side validation was enabled in the RJSF forms.

**Solution:**
- Enabled live validation in RJSF forms (`liveValidate=true`)
- Added error list display at top of forms (`showErrorList='top'`)
- Auto-focus first error field on submit (`focusOnFirstError=true`)
- Validate merged data when using multi-schema forms (action workflows)
- Show custom validation error alert when validation fails
- Added comprehensive CSS styling for error messages

**Benefits:**
- Real-time feedback as users type
- Clear error messages for missing fields
- Invalid submissions blocked before reaching backend
- Better UX and reduced backend load
- Prevents the root cause of hanging jobs

**Files Changed:**
- `/web/src/features/catalog/components/FormSection.tsx`
- `/web/src/features/catalog/hooks/useCatalogSubmit.ts`
- `/web/src/features/catalog/components/CatalogForm.tsx`
- `/web/src/styles/rjsf-form.css`
- `/docs/FORM_VALIDATION.md` (new)

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Empty Form Submission
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173
2. Click "Catalog" tab
3. Select "Client Connection Request"
4. Click "Execute Task" without filling any fields

**Expected Result:**
- Error list appears at top showing 3 required fields
- Fields show red borders
- Form submission is blocked
- No job is created

### Test Scenario 2: Multi-Schema Validation
1. Fill main form fields (client, goLiveDate)
2. Select action: "Install"
3. Action form appears below
4. Click "Execute Task" without filling action form

**Expected Result:**
- Validation error alert appears
- Shows which action fields are required
- Form submission is blocked
- No job is created

### Test Scenario 3: Valid Submission
1. Fill all main form fields
2. Select action: "Install"
3. Fill all action form fields
4. Click "Execute Task"

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Validation passes
- ✅ Job created successfully
- ✅ Redirected to job detail page
- ✅ Job shows in QUEUED state, then RUNNING, then SUCCEEDED/FAILED
