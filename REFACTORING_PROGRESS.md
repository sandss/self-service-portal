# Self-Service Portal Refactoring Progress

## ✅ COMPLETED REFACTORS

### 1. JobDetail Feature Refactor (Complete)
- **Component Structure**: 
  - Extracted job-related logic into `useJobDetailV2` custom hook
  - Broke down JobDetail into modular components: JobHeader, JobSummaryCard, JobProgressSection, JobTimeline, JobDataSection, JobLoading, JobError, JobDetailSkeleton
  - Created utility functions for job state formatting

- **State Management**: 
  - Implemented reducer-based state management (`jobReducer`, `JobState_Combined`)
  - Added structured error handling (`JobError`, `ErrorType`)
  - Centralized polling configuration and retry logic

- **UI/UX Improvements**:
  - Added skeleton loading components and JobDetailSkeleton
  - Enhanced components for better visuals and responsiveness
  - Added JsonViewer with collapsible, searchable, and copy-to-clipboard features
  - Improved accessibility and mobile responsiveness

### 2. File Structure Migration (Complete)
- **Features Architecture**:
  - Created `features/jobs/` with subfolders for components, hooks, pages, types, utils, constants
  - Created `features/catalog/` with same structure
  - Moved job-related files to new structure
  - Created barrel exports (`index.ts`) for clean imports

- **Shared Components**:
  - Created `shared/` for generic components and utilities
  - Moved reusable components: Skeleton, CopyButton, JsonViewer, ErrorAlert, LoadingSpinner, SuccessMessage, ConfirmationDialog
  - Added shared utilities: clipboardUtils

- **Route & Import Updates**:
  - Updated imports in all moved files
  - Fixed route configuration to use new feature imports
  - Resolved all Docker/Vite import errors

### 3. Catalog Feature Migration (Complete)
- **Component Migration**:
  - Moved all catalog components to `features/catalog/components/`
  - Fixed import paths to use new structure
  - Updated route configuration to use CatalogPage

- **Shared Component Organization**:
  - Moved generic components (ErrorAlert, LoadingSpinner, SuccessMessage, ConfirmationDialog) to shared/
  - Updated all references to use shared imports

## 🔄 IN PROGRESS

### Hook Migration to Features
- Catalog hooks still in legacy `hooks/` directory need to be moved to `features/catalog/hooks/`
- Hooks to migrate:
  - `useCatalogForm.ts`
  - `useCatalogItems.ts`
  - `useCatalogNavigation.ts`
  - `useButtonLabeling.ts`
  - `useDeleteOperations.ts`
  - `useErrorManagement.ts`
  - `useItemSelection.ts`
  - `useModalState.ts`

## 📋 NEXT PRIORITIES

### 1. Complete Catalog Hook Migration
- Move catalog-specific hooks to `features/catalog/hooks/`
- Update imports in catalog components
- Create barrel exports for catalog hooks

### 2. Clean Up Legacy Structure
- Remove empty directories
- Clean up unused imports
- Update any remaining legacy references

### 3. Types and Constants Migration
- Consider moving catalog-specific types to `features/catalog/types/`
- Consider moving catalog constants to `features/catalog/constants/`
- Evaluate if shared types need refactoring

### 4. Performance & Code Quality
- Add performance monitoring
- Implement code splitting for features
- Add comprehensive error boundaries
- Improve TypeScript strict mode compliance

### 5. Testing Infrastructure
- Add feature-specific test setup
- Create shared test utilities
- Implement component testing for new structure

### 6. Documentation
- Create feature-specific README files
- Document architectural decisions
- Create development guidelines for new structure
